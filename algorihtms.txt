1) Depth First Search
- transform a string/many strings to a tree and apply depth first Search

2) Breadth first search:
- take a tree and print it level by level

1 vs 2:
the order to traverse child nodes. 
dfs: use stack
bfs: use queue

3) Matching brackets problem
- matching brackets and whats the next bracket
- use a stack, if stack not empty, then something isn't matched

4) Making use of Hash Tables
- keep track of what I already visited. 
- keep track of numbers in array. cache values
- Dynamic programming - or use array to store values

5) Variables/Pointers manipulation
- traverse a string from left to right 
- traverse a linked list with 2 Pointers
- ex) find the longest palindramtic substring in a string, traverse full string every letter start 2 pointers expanding outward
